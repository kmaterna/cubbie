Perform a DEM error correction from Fattahi and Amelung, 2013, IEEE Proceedings.
This correction operates in the time domain after the SBAS inversion.
It solves for a term proportional to baseline history.
It cannot be used with weighted NSBAS.
It operates on unsmoothed time series, but smoothing can be added in later.
